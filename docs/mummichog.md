# Mummichog pathway analysis (pinned v2, isolated venv)

> Moved here from the top-level README, unchanged apart from heading levels. Back to the [docs index](README.md).

The metabolomics mode runs [mummichog](http://mummichog.org) for m/z-based pathway/network enrichment via a **version-pinned, isolated engine** (`R/domain/metabolomics/06c_mummichog_pinned.R`): `mummichog==2.7.0` invoked as a `{processx}` subprocess in a dedicated venv, depending only on light R packages (`readr`, `processx`, `jsonlite`) — no Bioconductor. It runs on mummichog's built-in `human_mfn` model by default.

## One-time setup

The pinned engine calls Python in a dedicated venv, kept out of git (`envs/` is `.gitignore`d). Once per machine (or checkout):

``` bash
make setup
```

That builds the venv (`envs/mummichog`) and **prints the exact `MUMMICHOG_PYTHON=<path>` line for this checkout**. Add just that line to your `.Renviron` (create the file in the project root if you don't have one — it's `.gitignore`d):

``` bash
# append the line make setup printed, e.g.:
echo 'MUMMICHOG_PYTHON=/abs/path/to/envs/mummichog/bin/python' >> .Renviron
```

> If you'd rather start from the tracked template with `cp .Renviron.example .Renviron`, also **set or remove its `MULTIOMICS_CONFIG=/path/to/your/config.yaml` placeholder** — an active dummy value there overrides the `config.yaml` default and makes `tar_make()` fail before it reaches mummichog.

After that, R reads `.Renviron` on start and `targets::tar_make()` just works — no manual `export` each session. **`.Renviron` is machine-specific and `.gitignore`d — never commit it** (that's why `make setup` prints the line for you to add rather than writing the file itself). A relative path works if you always start R from the project root, but the absolute path `make setup` prints is more robust.

<summary>Manual / advanced use</summary>

``` bash
make mummichog-venv                 # creates envs/mummichog, writes requirements-mummichog.lock
# or, to reproduce the exact committed tree:
make mummichog-lock                 # installs from requirements-mummichog.lock (USE_LOCK=1)

# instead of .Renviron, you can export the interpreter path per shell:
export MUMMICHOG_PYTHON="$(pwd)/envs/mummichog/bin/python"
```

On Windows the venv interpreter is at `envs\mummichog\Scripts\python.exe` instead (both `make setup` and the pipeline pick the right path per platform). Both `requirements-mummichog.txt` (the top-level pin) and `requirements-mummichog.lock` (the fully-resolved tree) are committed.

If the venv/interpreter is missing when the stage runs, the pipeline fails loudly and names the fix (`run make setup`) — it never silently builds a venv mid-run.

## How to run

It's wired into the metabolomics DAG (as `metab_mummichog_pinned_*` targets) and is **opt-in via config** — set `enabled: true` under `modes.metabolomics.enrichment.mummichog`. When disabled or omitted, the targets aren't added to the graph and the Python venv is never needed.

``` yaml
modes:
  metabolomics:
    enrichment:
      mummichog:
        enabled: true
        p_cutoff: 0.05
        n_permutations: 100
        tolerance_ppm: 10
        ionization_mode: pos_default   # pos_default | positive | negative
        force_primary_ion: true        # require a primary ion; false allows non-primary adducts
```

`force_primary_ion` maps to mummichog's `-z`. mummichog 2.7.0 **requires a primary ion** (`M+H[+]` for positive, `M-H[-]` for negative) to be present before accepting a metabolite prediction — this filters out noise from irrelevant adducts and is the engine's **default**. Set `force_primary_ion: false` to relax that (emits `-z False`, keeping adduct-only predictions); omit the key to keep the default. It maps to MetaboAnalyst's `force_primary_ion` option.

Then run as usual:

``` r
library(targets)
tar_make(names = tidyselect::starts_with("met"))
```

> **Per-contrast:** mummichog runs **independently for each differential-abundance contrast** (each contrast's own p-values define its significant set against all features, sharing one model + params). Every contrast with a result renders as its own tab in the HTML report's mummichog section and gets its own files on disk (see below).
>
> **Organism:** the built-in model is **human only**. A non-human `modes.metabolomics.organism` with no custom model is rejected with a clear error rather than silently run against the human network — supply an organism-specific model (see below).

## Choosing a metabolic model

The `-n` model is selected from the `mummichog` config block with this precedence:

1.  **`model_ref`** — a published model fetched by URL and verified against its `sha256`, then cached under `envs/mummichog-models/<sha256>.json` (a gitignored dir). This is the preferred way to run organism-specific models without committing large JSON into the repo: the file is downloaded once, checked, and reused on later runs as long as its content still matches the digest. A sha256 mismatch is a hard error — an unverified model is never used.
2.  **`model_json`** — a path to a local model JSON on the machine running the pipeline.
3.  **built-in `human_mfn`** — mummichog's bundled human model (the default).

``` yaml
modes:
  metabolomics:
    organism: "Caenorhabditis elegans"     # non-human -> a custom model is required
    enrichment:
      mummichog:
        enabled: true
        model_ref:
          url: https://github.com/multiomics-center-Israel/multiomics-annotation-prep/releases/download/cre_kegg_20260711/cre_kegg_20260711.json
          sha256: c403c96fbec8df9ae34b828fec01270c8ea3940acc36e4e5ff770868dc8b912b
```

Supplying any custom model (`model_ref` or `model_json`) also satisfies the human-only guard, so a non-human organism runs against its own network.

## Where outputs land

Under `<metab_out_dir>/mummichog_pinned/`, one subdirectory per contrast (`<contrast>/`, the contrast name sanitised to `A-Za-z0-9_`):

-   `<contrast>/input.tsv` and `<contrast>/input.tsv.idmap.tsv` — the exact table sent to mummichog for that contrast (m/z, retention time, p-value, statistic, **feature\_id as the 5th column**) plus a provenance id-map.
-   `<contrast>/v2/<timestamp>.<project>/` — the mummichog result tree: `result.html`, `tables/` (`mcg_pathwayanalysis_*.tsv`/`.xlsx`, `mcg_modularanalysis_*.tsv`/`.xlsx`, `ListOfEmpiricalCompounds.tsv`, `userInputData.txt`, `userInput_to_EmpiricalCompounds.tsv`), `figures/` and `js/`. Result tables are **`.tsv`/`.xlsx`, never `.csv`**.
-   `<contrast>/v2/mummichog_manifest.tsv` and `<contrast>/v2/runner.log`.

Plus, directly under `mummichog_pinned/`, the report's presentation exports per contrast: `mummichog_pathway_bubble_<contrast>.{png,pdf}` (the bubble plot) and `mummichog_pathway_table_<contrast>.{tsv,csv}` (the sorted pathway table), and `contrasts.tsv`, which maps each sanitised subdirectory name back to its original DE contrast label (so the report can show real contrast names).

To map pathways back to your feature ids, `join_features_to_results()` uses the feature id mummichog echoes into its own tables (via the 5th input column) — not the fragile post-de-duplication row numbers.

## Stochasticity caveat

mummichog v2 estimates null distributions by **random permutation with no seed control**, so p-values and rankings vary slightly between runs on identical input. `{targets}` only re-runs the stage when its inputs change, so this doesn't cause spurious rebuilds — but do **not** expect bit-identical reruns, and don't assert exact equality in tests.
